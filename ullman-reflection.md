**1.  What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I have been having trouble remembering to add new files to my repo prior to doing a commit, which leads to pushes and pull requests that don't have any files to review.
**2.  What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
My guide helped to clarify my problems with adding files to my commits, as well as some important steps to take for that process to help me to identify the problem.
**3.  What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
i asked for some assistance in how to set up my initial folder and repository.  I had previously been working on another assignment, so I needed to be sure not to mix up files in the different repos.
**4.  What still confuses you about git?**
I think I still need to work on the overall process, particularly adding files.  I need to remember that just because a file is new it is not slated to be a part of the commit.
**5.  How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I actually wound up in a GPS with only myself and the guide, so this probably wasn't a good first experience.  However, it was still a good experience in working with the guide, and she did help serve as my navigator at times, so I have a little bit of a feel for the process.
